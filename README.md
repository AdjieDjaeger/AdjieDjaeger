### **Hello, Fellow Code Geeks 👊😎👌**

I'm A**djie Djaka Permana**, loves to be called as **D'Jaeger** [_ˈdiːˈjɛːɡɐ, Dee'yega_]. Currently, I'm pursuing the path of **full-stack website development** 🌏 and I feel that I'm still a junior. Usually, I do development with either PHP or Javascript language depends on my client's need, yeah, I do freelancing also. While on Github, so far, I'm only doing translation on documentation that I find useful and interesting.

- 🔭 I’m currently **working** on self project called admin-djaeger, an admin template personalized for me, currently, it's private maybe will be public someday.

- 🌱 Also, I’m currently **develop** myself to be advanced at using React and its family (Next, Native, etc. maybe).
- 😄 Oh yeah, as I mentioned before, currently, I'm doing **documentation translation** from English to Bahasa as a **contribution** to [trekhleb](https://github.com/trekhleb)'s [javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms).
